# 📝 Week 3 Assignment: Static Review and Requirements Analysis

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

- Review documentation for clarity, correctness, and consistency  
- Perform a basic code walkthrough to identify potential defects  
- Practice providing feedback through GitHub Pull Request comments  
- Utilize GitHub Wiki and Issues for collaborative documentation review  

---

## 📋 What You’ll Need

- `requirements.md`: Contains specifications for the image gallery project  
- `gallery.html`: A small buggy JavaScript/HTML image gallery  
- GitHub Pull Request: You will review an open PR in the repository  

> ⚠️ **Important:** Do **not run** the code. This is a static review task. All analysis should be done by reading the code and documentation — not by executing it.

## 📝 Submission Instructions

Your submission must include **three components**:

### 1. 📄 Review `requirements.md`
- Navigate to `requirements.md` in the repo  
- Add comments directly using GitHub’s file review tools  
- Optionally, raise Issues for broader concerns and reference them in your PR comment  

### 2. 🔍 Review the Provided Pull Request
- Locate the PR titled e.g., `"Feature: Buggy Image Gallery"`  
- Add **at least 3 inline comments** that identify:
  - 🛑 Errors: Code that causes crashes or fails expected behavior  
  - ❓ Unclear Logic: Confusing, redundant, or hard-to-maintain code  
  - 🚫 Violations of Good Practices: Accessibility, performance, security, maintainability issues  

### 3. 🗂️ Submit `Static_Review_Summary.md`
Create a Markdown file titled `Static_Review_Summary.md` in your repository and include:

- ✅ What you reviewed (e.g., high-level summary of the two files)  
- 🐛 Types of issues found (e.g., maintainability, accessibility, security, logic errors)  
- 💭 Reflection on your static testing process — what worked, what was difficult, what you learned

## 📚 Assignment Questions (To include in `Static_Review_Summary.md`)

### **Question 1: Documentation Review**
- Are all features in `requirements.md` clearly defined?
- Were there unclear, missing, or contradictory elements?
- What improvements did you suggest via GitHub comments or Issues?

### **Question 2: Code Review**
- Summarize the 3 PR comments you made:
  - What types of issues did they address?
  - Why are they important to resolve?

### **Question 3: Reflection**
- What aspects of the requirements or code were unclear or problematic?
- Did you identify any missing validations, assumptions, or inconsistencies?
- What challenges did you face during static review, and what did you learn?
